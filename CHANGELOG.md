## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2023-06-09
### Added
- Wrapper classes for elements and containers.
- Ability to get inline styles and computed CSS styles.
- A bunch of utility functions.
- A whole bunch more tweaks and stuff.
### Note
- This version despite being completed in June 2023 somehow never got
  committed or published until October 2024, oops. In the meantime a bunch
  of the functionality that this used (or introduced) has changed, and now
  this library is in need of a lot of refactoring to make it up to date again.
  So the next release will be a fairly major change when I get around to it.

## [1.0.0] - 2023-01-20
